Accessible from any browser for quick and easy setup.
### ommand-line Version (Folder: GiftExchangeCLIVersion) (coming soon!)
More advanced options for handling exceptions and custom rules.
Allows exclusion rules (e.g., person 1 can't have person 2).
Ideal for organizers needing more control over pairings.
Fast, lightweight, and runs in a terminal/command prompt.

## Usage
